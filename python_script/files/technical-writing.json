Now, we link to the website directly as to prevent any outdated instructions\r\n- Rename triple backtick \"bash\" code snippets to \"sh\" (it is more semantically correct)\r\n- Reestablish title hierarchy (in some files, there were multiple level-1 headings, which made the docs look \"off\")\r\n- Improve miscellaneous formatting and wording\r\n\r\nI tried my best to keep the same writing style (sort of verbose, repetitive), so let me know if there is anything I should change\r\n\r\ncloses #4295",

        "body": "The code base is suffering from quite a bit of \"tech debt\". Here are some ideas for refactoring:\r\n\r\nAcross the code base nodes and edges sometimes use objects (kgxnode and kgxedge) and sometimes are represented in python dictionaries. Using dictionaries simplified reading and writing json files among other things, but it's really not ideal. We should replace all or most usage of dictionaries with real objects.\r\n\r\nMost of the node types, attribute names, and other strings that should be constants defined in one place are set up correctly now, but not all of them. Specifically, as mentioned above, nodes are sometimes represented as dictionaries and the properties \"id\" \"name\" and \"category\" are hard coded in many places. Using objects would solve this but something like \"category\" should not be in multiple places in the code base, it should be a constant.\r\n\r\nSome files are named poorly and should be moved around so that new developers can more quickly understand the overall structure. Load_manager and build_manager should be renamed and moved, as they are the entry points for usage, and those names are bad. Node and edge normalization should be moved out of utils. The \"kgx\" terminology is over used. \"node_types\" holds more than just node types now.",

It sets the standard on what is the expected form of written text\non this documentation site.\nYou write your text for a good reason. That reason is a clear and specific goal, so use it as a starting point. Only add\ndetail when it helps your audience to understand your message. Many engineers want to provide as much specific detail as\npossible, but this can come at the expense of a reader's understanding and his main point of reading.\nUse the following rules when writing and editing your text.\n## Most Important First\n- **avoid:** Elaborate and give every aspect of the context.\n- **instead:** immediately cut to the chase.\n## Brevity\n- **avoid:** When deploying the portal together with the orchestrator and site management, it is important to use the correct zip in the CDA command you try to execute\n- **instead:** Check that the CDA command you will execute has the correct zip.\n## Use words with clear meaning\n\nDo not use words that are ambiguous, vague, complex, abstract, or container words.\n- **avoid:** functionality, utilization, thing,\n- **instead:** feature, use\n## Remove redundancy\n- **avoid:** The code is stored in SVN. That is where you commit your code. The SVN location is url XYZ.\n- **instead:** Commit your code to SVN at url XYZ.\n## Be factual\n- **avoid:** subjective statements: A common idea is that CSS is difficult.\n- **instead:** leave it out, and stick to the facts. Fallback: You can have difficulty in writing CSS.\n## Be specific\n- **avoid:** The code is in SVN.\n- **instead:** The SVN location of the code is XYZ.\n## Active sentences\n- **avoid:** code must be written to adhere to the coding guidelines.\n- **instead:** you must write code that complies to the coding guidelines.\n## Use signposting\n\nSignposting sentences explain the structure of your text. They help the reader follow your line of thought, making it easier to read. See  for some examples.\n\nFor more writing tips and guidelines see: \n- http://web.mit.edu/me-ugoffice/communication/technical-writing.pdf \n- http://www.library.dmu.ac.uk/Support/Heat/index.php?page=488 \n- http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Technical_writing_style \n- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style \n- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:The_perfect_article\n",

One of the suggested topics was technical writing.\r\n\r\nWhat questions do you have about technical writing? This could be documentation, blogging, articles, books, any form of writing for technical people or on technical topics.\r\n\r\nDrop your questions below!\r\n```\r\n\r\ncc: @joenash ",

Once I open the app it continues but only after I have deleted the app and waited a few seconds everything stops.\r\n\r\nSo can anyone please tell me how it's even possible that this happens and how to stop it?\r\n#### Relevant Code:\r\n\r\nFirebase config:\r\n```\r\nimport { initializeApp } from 'firebase/app';\r\nimport { getAuth } from 'firebase/auth';\r\nimport { getFirestore,  initializeFirestore } from 'firebase/firestore';\r\n\r\n// Initialize Firebase\r\nconst firebaseConfig = {\r\n  ###\r\n};\r\n\r\n\r\nconst app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);\r\nconst auth = getAuth()\r\n\r\nconst db = initializeFirestore(app, {\r\n    experimentalForceLongPolling: true,\r\n});\r\n\r\nexport {auth ,app, db}\r\n```\r\n",

        "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe current version of GatorGrader does not have a way to perform spellchecking on the submitted technical writing. While it might be possible to leverage existing spellcheckers for different Unix-like platforms, it is probably a good idea to implement these checks in a platform independent fashion. If technical writing contains spelling mistakes that can be reliably detected, then this is a suitable circumstance in which we can fail a build.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nIt should be possible to specify a file in a directory and then have a new option called `--spellcheck`, using the current approach to the command-line arguments. This would then trigger a reliable, Python-based spellchecker. Here is an example of a project to consider: https://pypi.org/project/pyspellchecker/.\r\n\r\nLet me know what you think, @corlettim and @schultzh and @Michionlion. If you like this idea, then I can work with one of you to implement it or try to implement it on my own. With that said, I think that it might be advisable to wait to implement this until after we have introduced the linting interface.",

I completely forgot about the original PR (#1136) since it took a while to review so now I'm creating a new one.\r\nLinked issue: #109 \r\n\r\n## Approach\r\nI have added API calls to technic and solder for fetching modpack information and created modpack views + actions for solder and technic modpacks.\r\nUnfortunately, legacy API only supports the latest version and some releases do not any timestamps to use as release dates.\r\n\r\n#### Open Questions and Pre-Merge TODOs\r\n- [ ] Is there a better way for handling one-zip modpacks?\r\n- [ ] Most of the time, no information about required forge versions is returned, should this be extracted from version.json inside modpack.jar or left at the latest fml version?\r\n- [ ] Older modpacks (tekkit, etc.) fail to install due to missing minecraftforge libraries. This is also described in #1398.\r\n\r\n## Learning\r\n* Used API documentation for [Technic](https://technicapi.docs.apiary.io/#/) and [Solder](https://docs.solder.io/docs/api)\r\n* Sniffed a working build version for the API from Technic Launcher, since the [update endpoint](\r\nhttps://api.technicpack.net/launcher/version/) returns outdated data.\r\n\r\n",

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWe are using argocd-image-updater with git write back and have multiple independent clusters that deploy apps from that repository. We have a chart with multiple images and the resulting `.argocd-source.yaml` looks like one below.\r\n\r\n```YAML\r\nhelm:\r\n  parameters:\r\n  - name: myapp.image.repository\r\n    value: myreg.io/myorg/myapp\r\n    forcestring: true\r\n  - name: myapp.image.tag\r\n    value: 1.31.0\r\n    forcestring: true\r\n  ```\r\n  \r\nMy problem is, that some of these clusters are isolated to a level where they all can't pull images from the same registry. Mirroring images to local registries is not a problem, that we have solved already. But when registry (or repository) is defined in `.argocd-source.yaml` as parameter it seems to be impossible to override it anywhere. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI would like to be able to use git write back only for `image.tag`. `image.repository` is usually anyways defined trough Helm values.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nAs per https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/parameters/#store-overrides-in-git I tried creating additional `.argocd-source-<app name>.yaml` files that would only contain `image.repository` information. This resulted in all images missing their tag information as it seems arrays are not merged but overwritten. \r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nI could try providing a PR for this if there is no technical reason for writing registry information to git. Any ideas how to go around this are welcome if this behaviour can't be changed.\r\n",

        "body": "### What happened?\r\n\r\nBazel build documentation outdated and unable to build dotnet sources using Bazel on Windows. \r\n\r\nSteps like correctly setting up VCTools and MSBuild environment variables are unclear and there are either missing requirements or unclear specifications for portions of the Bazel build instructions. From what I understood after looking around for support on this topic it looks like this has been a long standing issue, as mention by @jimevans, due to a combination of factors:\r\n\r\n> If you try building using `bazel build //dotnet/\u2026`, you\u2019re going to have a Bad Time\u2122. The rule set used to build the .NET bindings is not the \u201cofficial\u201d Bazel .NET rules, because those rules make some assumptions that run counter to how .NET environments like to build. This is particularly so with multiple framework versions encompassing .NET Framewotk, .NET Core, and the subsequent unification of those with .NET 5 and beyond.. \r\n> \r\n> The ones we _do_ use, are much better in that regard, but they\u2019re also wildly incomplete, mostly in the execution of stuff using `bazel test` or `bazel run`. We attempt to use some custom rules in those cases, but they\u2019re, frankly speaking, poorly written.\r\n> \r\n> The custom rules\u2019 author (me) doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing when constructing Bazel rules, and no one with any real expertise in writing Bazel rules seems to have any interest in donating effort to make them actually work. Those same people with the proper Bazel skill set also usually have no understanding of the peculiarities of .NET projects, or the know how to make them to work seamlessly on Windows.\r\n\r\n- _Originally posted by @jimevans in https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/issues/9915#issuecomment-944896131_\r\n---\r\n\r\nI recently went through all of the steps in the documentation for a fresh setup, using the linked blog article for WIndows as a reference as well, and after spending a few hours trying to resolve it I was still ultimately unsuccessful in building even the dotnet project via VS command line.\r\n\r\n**Note:**  Building just the WebDriver, WebDriver.Support, and WebDriverBackedSelenium dotnet projects from within Visual Studio 2019 works and successfully builds the DLLs for each .NET standard and framework. Building the tests is a different story...\r\n\r\nWe should potentially consider moving away from the Bazel implementation for complete building via command line.\r\n\r\n### How can we reproduce the issue?\r\n\r\n- On latest Windows 10 with latest Visual Studio 2019 and Visual Studio Command Line Tools installed, follow all of the documented steps for setting up the Bazel build environment\r\n- You may need to use the linked blog article for assistance with some of the steps\r\n- Run command to build dotnet using Bazel: `bazel build //dotnet/`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Operating System\r\n\r\nWindows 10 v19044.1586\r\n\r\n### Selenium version\r\n\r\nFresh checkout of Selenium 4 trunk\r\n",

        "body": "## Tell us about the problem you're trying to solve\r\nToday when Airbyte writes to snowflake's internal staging that step is single-threaded.  Performance gains could be made by parallelizing that effort.  \r\n\r\n## Describe the solution you\u2019d like\r\nParallelize the PUT stage of writing files to Snowflake's internal staging\r\n\r\n## Describe the alternative you\u2019ve considered or used\r\nWhen writing to external staging for Snowflake we parallelize the COPY commands.  So technically we could leverage an external host, however that adds additional complexity and might not see the possible performance gains of using Snowflake's own internal staging\r\n\r\n## Additional context\r\nNA\r\n\r\n## Are you willing to submit a PR?\r\nNo\r\n",
